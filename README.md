# JavaScript Budgeter

JavaScript Budgeter is my project application for my JavaScript course with Code Louisvile in the Spring 2021 semester.

Budgeting is something that most adults do and each person has to find a system that works for them. The app that my wife and I use for our budget requires a premium membership to be able to either sync your bank account or upload CSV files to it. My frugality and desire to be able to produce an application that can handle CSV files was the inspiration for this project. This idea then gave me a platform to develop and test my JavaScript knowledge from the class so far.

JavaScript Budgeter allows the user to create their own budget categories and amounts, then input transactions, and upload CSV files containing transactions to have categories assigned to. As the budgets are set and transactions are assigned, the chart and the table will adjust to reflect the comparison between what has been planned and spent in each "family" of category.

Because the application only contains front-end code, user input does not persist after page refreshing. 

Here are the instructions for using the application:
* Create your budget categories first. To do this, scroll down to "Create Your Own Budget Categories". The first step is to select a "Family" to assign the category you are about to create. Next, type the name of your budget category and assign an amount to the category. Click "Add Category". This will assign the input to an object (`budgetCategoriesAll`) and push the object into an array (`budgetCategoryList`). Clicking the button should update the "Spent" and "Left Over" cells in the table row for the Family corresponding to the Family that you selected, as well as the "Total" table row at the bottom. The chart should update simultaneously. The suggested maximum value on the chart is $500, but the chart should adjust if the budget number is higher than $500. Note: Create all of the budget categories that you would like to use for your budget before moving on.
* Manually create your transactions using the input fields. In the `<select>`, you will be able to choose from the categories that you just created. Once you select a category, enter the Merchant, Date, and Amount for your transaction and click "Add to Category." This should add the input into an object (`inputTransactionsAll`) and push the object into an array (`transactionList`)
